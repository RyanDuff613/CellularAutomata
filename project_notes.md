# Project Notes

## User Stories
- As a user I should be able to...
  - View the page and see a grid
    - The grid should fill the majority of the width and height of the screen
  - Be prompted to select an initial state for the grid. 
    - A preset state
      - These are known states that lead to interesting behavior
      - I select one of these I want to get an explanation/history
    - A randomized state
    - An option to set a custom initial state by selecting cells on the grid. 
  - Be prompted to select a ruleset for the game.
    - Preset Rules (Conway's etc)
    - An option to set my own rules
      - If I select this I should see a form allowing me to select conditions under which a cell should live or die
  - Click a "Start/Stop" button to begin running the game. 
  - Click "Next Generation" and "Previous Generation" buttons to play the game one generation at a time.

## Planning

### Next Steps
- 
- Styling
  - Create wireframe


## Questions
- What does `npm run preview` do? When I run it, it looks like a server has been started at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/` but if I visit in the browser it says that no page was found there.
